# Pass Through

Pass-through tax treatment means that the taxes of a business are literally "passed through" to the tax returns of the individuals who own the business. The tax deduction isn't taken by the business, but it's taken by the individual taxpayer(s) who own the business.

These business entities are not subject to double taxation—once as the business earns income and again at the owners' level—as are corporations.

# Limited Liability Company

Limited Liability Company or LLC is a business structure in the United States whereby the owners are not personally liable for the company's debts or liabilities. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
