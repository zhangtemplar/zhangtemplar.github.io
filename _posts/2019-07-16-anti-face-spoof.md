> Face anti-spoofing is essential to prevent face recognition systems from a security breach. Much of the progresses have been made by the availability of face anti-spoofing benchmark datasets in recent years. However, existing face anti-spoofing benchmarks have limited number of subjects (≤170) and modalities (≤2), which hinder the further development of the academic community. To facilitate face anti-spoofing research, we introduce a large-scale multi-modal dataset, namely CASIA-SURF, which is the largest publicly available dataset for face anti-spoofing in terms of both subjects and visual modalities. Specifically, it consists of 1,000 subjects with 21,000 videos and each sample has 3 modalities (i.e., RGB, Depth and IR). We also provide a measurement set, evaluation protocol and training/validation/testing subsets, developing a new benchmark for face anti-spoofing. Moreover, we present a new multi-modal fusion method as baseline, which performs feature re-weighting to select the more informative channel features while suppressing the less useful ones for each modal. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the proposed dataset to verify its significance and generalization capability. The dataset is available at this https URL

> Face anti-spoofing is an important task in full-stack face applications including face detection, verification, and recognition. Previous approaches build models on datasets which do not simulate the real-world data well (e.g., small scale, insignificant variance, etc.). Existing models may rely on auxiliary information, which prevents these anti-spoofing solutions from generalizing well in practice. In this paper, we present a data collection solution along with a data synthesis technique to simulate digital medium-based face spoofing attacks, which can easily help us obtain a large amount of training data well reflecting the real-world scenarios. Through exploiting a novel Spatio-Temporal Anti-Spoof Network (STASN), we are able to push the performance on public face anti-spoofing datasets over state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Since the proposed model can automatically attend to discriminative regions, it makes analyzing the behaviors of the network possible.We conduct extensive experiments and show that the proposed model can distinguish spoof faces by extracting features from a variety of regions to seek out subtle evidences such as borders, moire patterns, reflection artifacts, etc.

> Face anti-spoofing is designed to keep face recognition systems from recognizing fake faces as the genuine users. While advanced face anti-spoofing methods are developed, new types of spoof attacks are also being created and becoming a threat to all existing systems. We define the detection of unknown spoof attacks as Zero-Shot Face Anti-spoofing (ZSFA). Previous works of ZSFA only study 1-2 types of spoof attacks, such as print/replay attacks, which limits the insight of this problem. In this work, we expand the ZSFA problem to a wide range of 13 types of spoof attacks, including print attack, replay attack, 3D mask attacks, and so on. A novel Deep Tree Network (DTN) is proposed to tackle the ZSFA. The tree is learned to partition the spoof samples into semantic sub-groups in an unsupervised fashion. When a data sample arrives, being know or unknown attacks, DTN routes it to the most similar spoof cluster, and make the binary decision. In addition, to enable the study of ZSFA, we introduce the first face anti-spoofing database that contains diverse types of spoof attacks. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state of the art on multiple testing protocols of ZSFA.

> Despite the large volume of face recognition datasets, there is a significant portion of subjects, of which the samples are insufficient and thus under-represented. Ignoring such significant portion results in insufficient training data. Training with under-represented data leads to biased classifiers in conventionally-trained deep networks. In this paper, we propose a center-based feature transfer framework to augment the feature space of under-represented subjects from the regular subjects that have sufficiently diverse samples. A Gaussian prior of the variance is assumed across all subjects and the variance from regular ones are transferred to the under-represented ones. This encourages the under-represented distribution to be closer to the regular distribution. Further, an alternating training regimen is proposed to simultaneously achieve less biased classifiers and a more discriminative feature representation. We conduct ablative study to mimic the under-represented datasets by varying the portion of under-represented classes on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. Advantageous results on LFW, IJB-A and MS-Celeb-1M demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature transfer and training strategy, compared to both general baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our feature transfer successfully presents smooth visual interpolation, which conducts disentanglement to preserve identity of a class while augmenting its feature space with non-identity variations such as pose and lighting.

> Face presentation attacks have become an increasingly critical issue in the face recognition community. Many face anti-spoofing methods have been proposed, but they cannot generalize well on "unseen" attacks. This work focuses on improving the generalization ability of face anti-spoofing methods from the perspective of the domain generalization. We propose to learn a generalized feature space via a novel multi-adversarial discriminative deep domain generalization framework. In this framework, a multi-adversarial deep domain generalization is performed under a dual-force triplet-mining constraint. This ensures that the learned feature space is discriminative and shared by multiple source domains, and thus is more generalized to new face presentation attacks. An auxiliary face depth supervision is incorporated to further enhance the generalization ability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

> Detecting spoofing attacks plays a vital role for deploying automatic face recognition for biometric authentication in applications such as access control, face payment, device unlock, etc. In this paper we propose a new anti-spoofing network architecture that takes advantage of multi-modal image data and aggregates intra-channel features at multiple network layers. We also transfer strong facial features learned for face recognition and show their benefits for detecting spoofing attacks. Finally, to increase the generalization ability of our method to unseen attacks, we use an ensemble of models trained separately for distinct types of spoofing attacks. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art result on the largest multi-modal anti-spoofing dataset CASIA-SURF.

> Face Anti-spoofing gains increased attentions recently in both academic and industrial fields. With the emergence of various CNN based solutions, the multi-modal(RGB, depth and IR) methods based CNN showed better performance than single modal classifiers. However, there is a need for improving the performance and reducing the complexity. Therefore, an extreme light network architecture(FeatherNet A/B) is proposed with a streaming module which fixes the weakness of Global Average Pooling and uses less parameters. Our single FeatherNet trained by depth image only, provides a higher baseline with 0.00168 ACER, 0.35M parameters and 83M FLOPS. Furthermore, a novel fusion procedure with ``ensemble + cascade'' structure is presented to satisfy the performance preferred use cases. Meanwhile, the MMFD dataset is collected to provide more attacks and diversity to gain better generalization. We use the fusion method in the Face Anti-spoofing Attack Detection Challenge@CVPR2019 and got the result of 0.0013(ACER), 0.999(TPR@FPR=10e-2), 0.998(TPR@FPR=10e-3) and 0.9814(TPR@FPR=10e-4).

> Face anti-spoofing detection is a crucial procedure in biometric face recognition systems. State-of-the-art approaches, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), present good results in this field. However, previous works focus on one single modal data with limited number of subjects. The recently published CASIA-SURF dataset is the largest dataset that consists of 1000 subjects and 21000 video clips with 3 modalities (RGB, Depth and IR). In this paper, we propose a multi-stream CNN architecture called FaceBagNet to make full use of this data. The input of FaceBagNet is patch-level images which contributes to extract spoof-specific discriminative information. In addition, in order to prevent overfitting and for better learning the fusion features, we design a Modal Feature Erasing (MFE) operation on the multi-modal features which erases features from one randomly selected modality during training. As the result, our approach wins the second place in CVPR 2019 ChaLearn Face Anti-spoofing attack detection challenge. Our final submission gets the score of 99.8052% (TPR@FPR = 10e-4) on the test set.
