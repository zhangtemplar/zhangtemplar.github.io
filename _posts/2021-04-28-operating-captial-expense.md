An operating [expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp) (OPEX) is an expense required for the day-to-day functioning of a business. In contrast, a [capital expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) (CAPEX) is an expense a business incurs to create a benefit in the future. Operating expenses and capital expenses are treated quite differently for accounting and tax purposes. This note is based on my reading of [The Difference Between an Operating Expense vs. a Capital Expense](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-difference-between-operating-expense-and-capital-expense.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20An%20Operating%20Expense,a%20benefit%20in%20the%20future.)

The table below compares two types of expenses. Note, in running its business, a company sometimes has a choice of whether to incur an operating expense or a capital expense. For example, if a company needs more storage space for housing its data, it can either invest in new data storage devices as a capital expense or lease space in a data center as an operational expense.

Capital expenses are recorded as assets on a company's [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) rather than as expenses on the income statement. The [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/how-should-company-budget-capital-expenditures.asp) is then [depreciated](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) over the total life of the asset, with a period depreciation expense charged to the company's income statement, normally monthly. Accumulated depreciation is recorded on the company's balance sheet as the summation of all depreciation expenses, and it reduces the value of the asset over the life of that asset.

A non-operating expense is an expense incurred by a business that is unrelated to the business' core operations. The most common types of non-operating expenses are interest charges or other costs of borrowing and losses on the disposal of assets. Accountants sometimes remove non-operating expenses to examine the performance of the business, ignoring effects of financing and other irrelevant issues.
