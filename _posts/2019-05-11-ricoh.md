RICOH SP 204SN DDST is a nice affordable multifunctional (scan, print and copy) printer available at around $150 and with toner available at $70 (or $35 for 3rd party). It works nice under Windows but doesn't work under Linux or Mac due to lack of driver.

Fortunately, there is an open source repository [ricoh-sp100](https://github.com/madlynx/ricoh-sp100), which enables the RICOH SP 204SN DDST under CUPS. It was intented for CUPS driver for Ricoh Aficio SP 100 familty printers, but also works for RICOH SP 204SN as well.

# Installation

To install it, you need to have a Linux (MacOS doesn't work, as the dependency cannot be met), for which I recommend to use the raspberry PI. You can take the following steps (for more detail please refer to [INSTALL](https://github.com/madlynx/ricoh-sp100/blob/master/INSTALL)):
```
git clone https://github.com/madlynx/ricoh-sp100.git
cd ricoh-sp100
chmod +x check-requirements
./check-requirements
```

Please install any missing dependencies you found from the output, you should have something like below to proceed:
```
pbmtojbg     [REQUIRED] : Yes, version: PBMtoJBIG converter 2.1 -- creates bi-level image entity (BIE) as output file
identify     [REQUIRED] : Yes, version: Version: ImageMagick 6.8.9-9 Q16 arm 2017-03-01 http://www.imagemagick.org
Ghostscript  [REQUIRED] : Yes, version: 9.06
ps2write     [REQUIRED] : Yes
pbmraw       [REQUIRED] : Yes
inotify-wait [optional] : No
```

Then copy `pstoricohddst-gdi` to cups' filters directory and make sure it is executable by lp user and owned by root:root
```
chown root:root pstoricohddst-gdi
cp pstoricohddst-gdi /usr/lib/cups/filter
```

Finally open [CUPS webinterface](http://localhost:631/) to add your Ricoh printer to CUPS. You could verify it is working by printing a test page: `printers\ricoh\maintenance\print test page`.

# Google Cloud Print

Please refer to [A Raspberry Pi Cloud Print Proxy](https://davesteele.github.io/raspberrypi/2016/04/23/raspberry-pi-cloudprint/) for how to make the Ricoh works with Google Cloud Print via Raspberr Pi.

```
echo "deb http://davesteele.github.io/cloudprint-service/repo cloudprint-jessie main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudprint.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

```

```
sudo cps-auth
sudo systemctl restart cloudprintd
