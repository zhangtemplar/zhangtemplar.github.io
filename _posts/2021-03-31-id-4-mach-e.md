As Tesla stock owner, I decided to have a test drive VolksWagon ID 4 and Ford Mach E to evaluate my long position in Tesla. I am located in San Jose bay area. My experience is both cars are very good car and their experiences significantly reduce the transition efforts from gaosline to EV, compared with Tesla. Instead of being a risk to Tesla (at least for coming few years), I would say it is a risk to other models of Volkswagon and Ford.

My experience is:

- the price is $44995 for base model and about $60000 for most expansive model. The dealer is not asking for mark up fee;
- it currently takes 8~9 weeks to fill up the order;
- Ford Mach E's interior is more similar as Tesla Model S (show above) than other Ford Cars. But it still provides many buttons as you find from gasoline cars, which enables you to pick up the driving without too much practice;
- accerlation is very good (much better than my Mercedes GLC 350 E, which is plug in hybrid);
- the mileage is about 270 miles per charge (I didn't test it);
- it is quite even when accerlating;
- it has both front truck and rear truck as Tesla.
- it has lane detection, but it only warns you when you deviate from the lane and it won't stear the wheel for you;
- it has adaptive cruise control to maintain the distance to the car in front of you. But I don't get the chance to test it;
- Ford Mach E doesn't have the sensors necessary for FSD like experience;

My experiene is:

- the price is $39995 for base model and $44495 for most expansive model. The dealer is asking for $1500 mark up fee;
- it currently takes 8~9 weeks to fill up the order;
- The interior is more like traditional gaosline car, compared with Ford Mach E. it provides many buttons as you find from gasoline cars, which enables you to pick up the driving without too much practice;
- accerlation is just so so. It feels like my Mercedes GLC 350e and is less responsive as Ford Mach E;
- the mileage is also about 270 miles per charge (I didn't test it);
- it is quite even when accerlating;
- it only has rear truck! The front compartment of the car is full of machenicals like gasoline car;
- it has lane detection, but it only warns you when you deviate from the lane and it won't stear the wheel for you;
- it has adaptive cruise control to maintain the distance to the car in front of you. In my test, it is very responsive;
- VolksWagon ID 4 doesn't have the sensors necessary for FSD like experience;
