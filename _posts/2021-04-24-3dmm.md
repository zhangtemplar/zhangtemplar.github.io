# FaceWareHouse

[FaceWareHouse](http://kunzhou.net/zjugaps/facewarehouse/) is a database of 3D facial expressions for visual computing applications. Some highlights:

- learned from data captured from Kinect includes 159 subjects and 20 expressins each. The quality and resolution of Kinect depth camea is at millimeter level;
- bilinear model with identity and expression on different axis $$V=C_r\times W_{id}\times W_{exp}$$, with $$W_{id}\in\mathbb{R}^{150}$$ and $$W_{exp}\in\mathbb{R}^{47}$$;

# FLAME

[FLAME](http://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/) parametrizes the 3D face mesh by identity $$\beta\in\mathbb{R}^{100}$$, expression $$\psi\in\mathbb{R}^{50}$$ and head pose $$\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{15}$$). Some highlights of FLAME:

- learned from 33000 3D scans of several hertergenous dataset including about 3800 identities, 8000 scans for poses and 69000 frames for expressions;
- strictly linear model for identity, expression and pose;
- the idenity and expression basis are orthornomal and computed from data. The number of basis are configurable;
- pose contains global pose, neck pose, jaw pose and two pupil poses;
- FLAME also supports different rendering to output the 2D image.  

FLAME could be written as:

$$M(\beta,\theta,\psi)=W(T+B_S(\beta,S)+B_p(\theta,P)+B_E(\psi,E),J(\beta),\theta)$$

This figure shows the coverage of variability given different number of basis.

# FaceScape

[FaceScape](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Yang_FaceScape_A_Large-Scale_High_Quality_3D_Face_Dataset_and_Detailed_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) provides large-scale high-quality 3D face datasets, parametric models, docs and toolkits about 3D face related technology.  It is published in CVPR 2020 and code is available in [github](https://github.com/zhuhao-nju/facescape). FaceScape utilizes a bilinear model instead of linear model in [FLAME](#flame).

Some highlights of FaceScape:

- learned from 18760 scans from 938 subjects and 20 expressions each;
- bilinear model with identity and expression on different axis $$V=C_r\times W_{id}\times W_{exp}$$, with $$W_{id}\in\mathbb{R}^{938}$$ and $$W_{exp}\in\mathbb{R}^{52}$$;
- captured with high quality multi-view systemconsists of 68 DSLR cameras, 30 of which capture 8K images focusing on front side, and the other cameras capture 4K level images for the side part.
