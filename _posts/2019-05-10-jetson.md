You should refer to [Getting Started With Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) to set up your Jetson Nano from hardware side

# Install TensorFlow

Please refer to [TensorFlow For Jetson Platform](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/install-tf-xavier/index.html) for installing the Tensorflow.

The step is intuitive:
```
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev hdf5-tools
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install -U pip
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev zip libjpeg8-dev libhdf5-dev 
sudo pip3 install -U numpy grpcio absl-py py-cpuinfo psutil portpicker grpcio six mock requests gast h5py astor termcolor
```

However, please note there is a bug for `pip@19.1` (for more information, please read [After pip 10 upgrade on pyenv "ImportError: cannot import name 'main'"](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5240)):
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip3", line 9, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name 'main'
```

To fix it, there are several possbilties:
- modifiy the pip file: `from pip._internal import main`
- try to install a version without this bug: `pip install --upgrade pip==9.0.3`

# Install Jupyter

Perhaps you may not be able to hook a keyboard and monitor to your Jetson all the time, then you could consider to use a Jupyter notebook to control Jetson.

```
sudo pip3 install ipython jupyter
mkdir ~/.jupyter
touch ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
jupyter notebook --generate-config ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```

You can set the content of `jupyter_notebook_config.py` as following:
```
...
c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'
c.NotebookApp.port = 8888
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
## Whether to allow the user to run the notebook as root.
c.NotebookApp.allow_root = True
...
```

](https://tech.amikelive.com/node-768/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-as-service-for-tensor-flow-and-deep-learning-on-ubuntu-16-04/)

Then you may want to make the Jupyter to automatically run at each restart of the device. You could do that by making Jupyer as a service:

```
sudo loginctl enable-linger your_user_name_here
sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/jupyter.service
sudo systemctl enable jupyter.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart jupyter.service
```

The content of `/usr/lib/systemd/system/jupyter.service` is shown below:
```
[Unit]
Description=Jupyter Notebook

[Service]
Type=simple
PIDFile=/run/jupyter.pid
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/jupyter notebook
User=your_user_name_here
Group=your_user_name_here
WorkingDirectory=/home/your_user_name_here/Documents/jupyter
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
#KillMode=mixed

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You could verify the Jupyter is running by visiting `localhost:8888`. If anything is wrong, you could check the error from: `journalctl -u jupyter.service`

Finally install some packages:
```
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev
sudo apt-get install graphviz
sudo pip3 install matplotlib
sudo pip3 install pydot graphviz
```
