Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is a type of artificial intelligence (AI). It involves training artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn patterns and representations from large datasets. Deep learning has been particularly successful in tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous decision-making, making it a powerful tool for solving complex problems in various domains. It relies on the concept of hierarchical feature extraction to automatically discover and understand data patterns, allowing it to make predictions or classifications without explicit programming.
