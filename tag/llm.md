A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence model designed for natural language processing tasks. These models, such as GPT-3, are characterized by their vast size, often containing hundreds of millions to billions of parameters, which are the variables that the model uses to make predictions. Large language models are pre-trained on massive text corpora and can understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They have the ability to perform a wide range of language-related tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, question-answering, and more. Due to their size and training data, they can exhibit impressive language comprehension and generation capabilities.
