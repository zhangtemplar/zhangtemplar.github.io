Text-to-image generation is a technology that converts textual descriptions or captions into corresponding visual images or illustrations. It's a subfield of artificial intelligence and generative modeling that uses techniques like deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create images from textual input. This technology has various applications, including generating images from written descriptions, creating visual content based on natural language prompts, and assisting in graphic design and content creation. It can be used for tasks such as generating artwork, scene visualization, or enhancing accessibility for individuals with visual impairments.
