A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a machine learning technique that consists of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, engaged in a game-like framework. The generator's role is to create synthetic data, such as images or text, while the discriminator's task is to distinguish between real data and the generated data. They iteratively improve each other: the generator tries to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator gets better at telling them apart. This adversarial process results in the generator producing high-quality, realistic data, making GANs widely used for tasks like image generation, style transfer, and data augmentation.
