Diffusion-based image editing is a technique that applies a diffusion process to manipulate and enhance digital images. It involves iteratively changing pixel values in an image according to a diffusion equation, where neighboring pixel values influence each other. This process can be used for various image enhancement tasks, including noise reduction, image smoothing, and edge-preserving filtering. By gradually diffusing and adjusting pixel values, diffusion-based image editing algorithms can achieve visually pleasing results, making images appear more appealing and improving their quality for various applications in photography, computer vision, and image processing.
